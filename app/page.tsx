  I'm Julian Munyard â€” a multidisciplinary musician, producer, and creator. This page outlines my creative practice, current projects, and my vision for using the ArtsPay Foundation grant to build deeper connections between sound, visual tools, and the communities that engage with them. I recently moved from the rural town of Beerwah in the Sunshine Coast of Queensland where I grew up, to Sydney â€“ purely to be closer to what I feel is a better music scene with more opportunities for me and my career as an artist.

</div>
<br /><br />

<p style={{ lineHeight: '1.6', fontSize: '16px' }}>
  I started producing music at 17 in my parents home in Beerwah, figuring out how to use programs like Logic Pro. By 20 I was recording any chance I could get, and at 21 (last year), I was invited to live in Sydney by some friends who were also chasing the same dream. Finding those like-minded people was something I couldnâ€™t do in my hometown, and the move has been a crucial part of my journey toward finishing my next body of work.
</p>

<br />

<p style={{ lineHeight: '1.6', fontSize: '16px' }}>
  I've recorded an EP of 6 tracks which have been recorded in my Sydney sharehouse with only the equipment available to me. The songs are early to mid 80s Boogie Funk inspired tunes. During that era, they would usually roll in over a few days and cut the tracks with a drum machine, some synthesizers and one engineer. So I wrote my songs with that in mind.
</p>

<br />

<p style={{ lineHeight: '1.6', fontSize: '16px' }}>
  I was heavily inspired by songs released on reissue labels such as Numero Group and the likes of. Early 80s boogie was a lot like 60s soul in that way â€” there was just so much of it created and not all of it was successful, so you have these great tracks that got lost along the way. A lot of those old songs have influenced me to write this collection of tunes.

  <h2>What Iâ€™ll Do With the Grant</h2>

<p style={{ lineHeight: '1.6', fontSize: '16px' }}>
  This grant would be used to help put out the body of work that Iâ€™ve been making in Sydney this year.
  I plan to use this funding for visuals, a marketing budget, and importantly â€“ collaboration and mixing/mastering time with{' '}

    KESMAR
  </a>
  , whom Iâ€™ve decided Iâ€™d like to mix the record. The funding would also allow me to take some time off work to get these things done in good time.

  <br /><br />

  This funding feels especially important right now. Iâ€™ve spent the last 9 months building my creative network in Sydney, writing and producing the music, connecting with industry â€” along with my showcase performances at Australiaâ€™s music conference <strong>BIGSOUND</strong>. I now require the funding to finish additional mixing and mastering for the tracks as well as investment into marketing.
  
  <br /><br />

  The momentum built here with my professional connections and social media reach is time sensitive due to the distributor <strong>Believe</strong> wanting to get the record out before the end of the year â€” which admittedly, I do as well! Tass from Believe reached out after watching my BIGSOUND showcase last year. More so, there is a time crunch to mix and master, film content, and completely wrap up the production.
</p>

<p style={{ lineHeight: '1.6', fontSize: '16px', marginTop: '40px' }}>
  My short form content from last year did great numbers and gained me over 10K followers on Instagram, with some videos doing over 250K views and lots of new fans.
</p>

<div style={{ margin: '24px 0' }}>
  <InstagramEmbed />
</div>

<p style={{ lineHeight: '1.6', fontSize: '16px' }}>
  For this next project, I want to apply that same approach â€” making content that connects â€” but with the added support of a proper marketing budget.
  That would allow me to put some targeted ad spend behind it, helping the music reach more people and giving it the best possible chance to land. 

  <br /><br />

  Touching on the theme and vision for the music: nostalgia is a big part of it for me â€” bringing back the authentic sounds and aesthetic of the early 80s.
  Iâ€™ve always been obsessed with the past and in keeping old things alive, and more importantly, doing anything that is real, things that you can feel, see and almost touch.

  Iâ€™ve been building this site independently to push how music can be experienced digitally, and I believe it reflects my broader artistic vision: bridging sound, technology, and storytelling. 
  This sort of tactile way of experiencing music is needed now more than ever in the age of AI, and the Munyard Mixer is a nod to a simpler time.

  <br /><br />

  This grant would support the continued development of this website, and sufficient ad spend would be allocated towards marketing it to the right audience (i.e. artists in Australia and worldwide who are actively making and releasing music).

  I now have the honor of being great friends with him and also roommates.

  <br /><br />

  This alone is enough to see why I wish to have him involved in my project by having KESMAR mix and master the record, which in turn requires funds (approx $2500).
